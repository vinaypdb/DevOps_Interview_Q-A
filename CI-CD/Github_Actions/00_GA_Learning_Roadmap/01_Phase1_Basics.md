# ðŸ“˜ GitHub Actions Learning Phases

## âœ… Overview

GitHub Actions is a powerful CI/CD and automation platform built directly into GitHub repositories. It allows you to automate workflows for building, testing, and deploying code right from your repository.

---

## ðŸ“— Phase 1: GitHub Actions Basics

* What is GitHub Actions?
* Core Concepts: Workflows, Jobs, Steps, Actions, Events
* GitHub Actions YAML file structure
* Triggering workflows (push, pull\_request, schedule)
* Running basic scripts using `runs`
* Using prebuilt actions from GitHub Marketplace
* Workflow syntax and structure
* Debugging workflows

---

## ðŸ“˜ Phase 2: Intermediate GitHub Actions

* Using environment variables and secrets
* Matrix builds for parallel testing
* Job dependencies and conditions (`needs`, `if`)
* Reusable workflows (`workflow_call`)
* Artifacts and cache management
* Using Docker containers in jobs
* GitHub-hosted vs self-hosted runners

## ðŸ“™ Phase 3: Real-World Projects with GitHub Actions

1. CI Pipeline for a Node.js App (lint + test + build)
2. Build and Push Docker Image to Docker Hub
3. Deploy Static Site to GitHub Pages
4. Auto Release Generator using GitHub Actions
5. Trigger Argo CD App Deployment from Workflow
