Jenkins is an open-source automation server used for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD).

---

### 15. **What is Ansible?**

Ansible is an open-source configuration management tool that automates software provisioning and application deployment.

---

### 16. **What is Git?**

Git is a distributed version control system used to track code changes and collaborate with other developers.

---

### 17. **What is GitOps?**

GitOps is a DevOps practice where Git is the source of truth for declarative infrastructure and application configuration.

---

### 18. **What is a pipeline in DevOps?**

A pipeline is a series of automated steps (build, test, deploy) to deliver software efficiently.

---

### 19. **What is Blue-Green Deployment?**

It’s a release strategy that reduces downtime by running two environments (Blue = old, Green = new) and switching traffic when Green is ready.

---

### 20. **What is Canary Deployment?**

A technique where a small portion of users receive the new version before rolling out to everyone, reducing risk.

---

### 21. **What is Monitoring in DevOps?**

Monitoring involves collecting metrics, logs, and alerts to observe the performance and health of infrastructure and applications.

---

### 22. **What is Prometheus?**

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring tool that collects metrics and uses PromQL for queries.

---

### 23. **What is Grafana?**

Grafana is a visualization tool that displays metrics from sources like Prometheus on customizable dashboards.

---

### 24. **What is the ELK Stack?**

ELK stands for Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana, used for centralized logging and visualization.

---

### 25. **What is Configuration Management?**

Configuration Management ensures that the systems are configured consistently using tools like Ansible, Puppet, or Chef.

---

### 26. **What is a reverse proxy and how does NGINX help in DevOps?**

A reverse proxy forwards client requests to backend servers. NGINX can act as a reverse proxy and load balancer to handle traffic efficiently.

---

### 27. **What is the purpose of load balancing?**

Load balancing distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to improve availability, scalability, and fault tolerance.

---

### 28. **What is a Service Mesh?**

A Service Mesh manages service-to-service communication with features like load balancing, encryption, and observability. Example: Istio.

---

### 29. **What is a rolling update?**

A deployment strategy where the new version is gradually rolled out to replace the old version with minimal downtime.

---

### 30. **What is a rollback?**

Reverting to a previous stable version of an application in case of failure during deployment.

---

### 31. **What is the difference between scalability and elasticity?**

* **Scalability**: Ability to increase resources to meet demand.
* **Elasticity**: Ability to scale up/down dynamically based on demand.

---

### 32. **What is fault tolerance?**

The ability of a system to continue functioning even when some components fail.

---

### 33. **What is high availability?**

Designing systems to ensure maximum uptime and accessibility.

---

### 34. **What is the difference between a process and a thread?**

* **Process**: An independent program in execution.
* **Thread**: A lightweight sub-process sharing memory space.

---

### 35. **What are environment variables?**

Key-value pairs used to configure application behavior without changing the code.

Webhooks trigger actions (like CI/CD jobs) when events occur in a system (e.g., Git push).

---

### 38. **What is the difference between vertical and horizontal scaling?**

* **Vertical scaling**: Adding more power (CPU/RAM) to existing machines.
* **Horizontal scaling**: Adding more machines to handle load.

---

### 39. **What is container orchestration?**

Managing the deployment, scaling, and operation of containers using tools like Kubernetes.

---

### 40. **What is a build artifact?**

A build artifact is the output of a build process (e.g., JAR, WAR, Docker image).

---

### 41. **What is DevSecOps?**

DevSecOps integrates security into every stage of the DevOps pipeline.

---

### 42. **What is static code analysis?**

Analyzing source code for vulnerabilities and bugs without executing it. Tools: SonarQube, ESLint.

---

### 43. **What is dynamic code analysis?**

Analyzing an application in a running state to detect security flaws.
