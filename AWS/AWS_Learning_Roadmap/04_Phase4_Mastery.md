## ‚úÖ Topics & Activities Covered

### 1. **Teach-Back Approach**

Reinforce your learning by teaching AWS concepts to others.

#### a. How to Teach AWS:

* Break down complex services into simple analogies
* Use whiteboarding to explain VPC, Lambda, ELB, etc.
* Write blog posts or create tutorial videos
* Explain a service‚Äôs use case, cost, and setup

#### b. Example Topics:

* ‚ÄúHow does AWS Lambda work?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúDesigning a secure 3-tier architecture on AWS‚Äù
* ‚ÄúAWS Storage options and when to use what‚Äù

---

### 2. **Architecture Design & Whiteboarding**

Build system design confidence by solving use cases and drawing architectures.

#### a. Key Architecture Patterns:

* Scalable Web Application (EC2/ALB/Auto Scaling + RDS)
* Serverless Microservices (API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB)
* Global Content Delivery (CloudFront + S3 + Route 53)
* Real-time Data Processing (Kinesis + Lambda + S3)

#### b. Tools:

* Use tools like draw\.io, Lucidchart, or whiteboards
* Practice drawing and explaining your architecture in interviews

#### c. Hands-on:

* Design an HA architecture with multi-AZ RDS
* Diagram and explain a serverless pipeline

---

### 3. **Certification Preparation**

Even if not mandatory, certifications validate your expertise.

#### a. Recommended Certifications:

* **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** *(Foundation)*
* **AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate** *(Most popular for DevOps/Cloud roles)*
* **AWS Certified Developer - Associate**
* **AWS Certified SysOps Administrator**
* Advanced: DevOps Pro, Solutions Architect Pro, Security Specialty

#### b. Study Materials:

* AWS Skill Builder, Udemy, Whizlabs, Tutorials Dojo
* Practice Exams & Whitepapers
* Use AWS Free Tier for labs

#### c. Tips:

* Focus on services architecture and use cases
* Study real-world problems, not just definitions

---

### 4. **Real-World Scenario Practice**

#### a. Mock Interviews:

* Pair up with peers or mentors
* Practice architecture-based and service-specific Q\&A

#### b. Projects to Build or Present:

* Migrate a monolithic app to microservices on AWS
* Design a secure, resilient e-commerce platform
* Automate infrastructure using Terraform + CodePipeline

---

### 5. **Community Engagement & Thought Leadership**

Share your learning with the community.

#### a. Platforms:

* GitHub: Host your AWS project repos
* Medium or Dev.to: Publish case studies, how-tos
* LinkedIn: Share learning milestones and resources
* YouTube: Demo real projects or explain services

#### b. Benefits:

* Build your tech credibility
* Attract opportunities (jobs, mentorships)
* Reinforce what you‚Äôve learned
