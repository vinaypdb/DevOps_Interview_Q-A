## 🐳 What is Docker?

**Docker** is a **containerization platform**. It allows developers and DevOps engineers to **package applications and their dependencies into containers**.

> 🔹 Think of a container as a **lightweight, portable box** that holds everything your application needs to run—code, libraries, config files, and environment variables.

## 🔧 Why Use Docker?

| Benefit                     | Explanation                                                                                         |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🚀 **Fast and Lightweight** | Containers start in milliseconds. They are much faster and lighter than virtual machines (VMs).     |
| 🔄 **Consistency**          | The same container runs on your laptop, a test server, or a production server without modification. |
| 📦 **Portability**          | Containers are portable across different OSes and cloud platforms.                                  |
| 📚 **Dependency Isolation** | Each container has its own dependencies; no more “it works on my machine” issues.                   |
| 📈 **Scalability**          | Works seamlessly with Kubernetes for scalable deployments.                                          |

## 📁 Docker vs Virtual Machine (VM)

| Feature      | Docker (Container)    | VM                           |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| OS           | Shares host OS kernel | Has its own OS               |
| Speed        | Very fast             | Slower                       |
| Size         | Lightweight (MBs)     | Heavy (GBs)                  |
| Startup Time | Milliseconds          | Minutes                      |
| Use Case     | Microservices, DevOps | Monoliths, Full OS Emulation |

## 🧱 Core Docker Concepts

### 1. 🖼️ **Docker Image**

* A **read-only template** that contains the instructions for creating a container.
* Built using a **Dockerfile**.

### 2. 📦 **Docker Container**

* A **runtime instance** of an image.
* Containers are **isolated** from each other and the host system.

### 3. 📝 **Dockerfile**

* A text file containing **instructions to build a Docker image**.

**Example:**

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.9
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### 4. 📚 **Docker Registry**

* A **repository for Docker images** (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR).

### 5. 🔀 **Docker Commands**

| Command        | Description                       |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `docker build` | Builds image from Dockerfile      |
| `docker run`   | Runs a container from an image    |
| `docker ps`    | Lists running containers          |
| `docker stop`  | Stops a running container         |
| `docker exec`  | Runs a command inside a container |
| `docker logs`  | Shows logs of a container         |
| `docker pull`  | Downloads image from registry     |
| `docker push`  | Uploads image to registry         |

### 6. 🌐 **Docker Networking**

| Mode      | Description                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `bridge`  | Default, container gets a private IP             |
| `host`    | Shares host network directly                     |
| `none`    | No network interface                             |
| `overlay` | Used with Docker Swarm for multi-host networking |

### 7. 💾 **Docker Volumes**

* Used to **persist data** outside the container’s file system.

**Example:**

```bash
docker run -v myvolume:/data busybox
```

### 8. 🔄 **Docker Compose**

* Tool to define and run multi-container apps using a `docker-compose.yml` file.

**Example:**

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: mywebapp
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
  db:
    image: postgres
```

Run the stack:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

### 9. 🛠️ **Docker Architecture**

| Component                     | Role                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Docker Engine**             | The runtime that runs containers          |
| **Docker CLI**                | Command-line tool to interact with Docker |
| **Docker Daemon (`dockerd`)** | Background process managing containers    |
| **Docker Images**             | Read-only templates                       |
| **Docker Containers**         | Running instances                         |
| **Docker Registry**           | Stores and distributes images             |

### 10. 🚦 Docker Lifecycle

1. Write Dockerfile
2. Build image: `docker build -t myapp .`
3. Run container: `docker run -p 8080:80 myapp`
4. (Optional) Push to registry: `docker push username/myapp`

### 11. 🧪 Real-World Use Cases

| Use Case                 | How Docker Helps                             |

| Microservices            | Each service in its own isolated container   |
| Cloud Migration          | Portable across cloud platforms              |
| Legacy App Modernization | Containerize old apps for new environments   |

### 12. 🧰 Bonus Tools
