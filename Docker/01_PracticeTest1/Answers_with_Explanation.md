27. **B - docker restart <id>**
    Restarts a stopped or running container.

28. **A - docker history <image>**
    Displays layer-by-layer history of image creation.

    Gives detailed configuration info about a container.

    Default subnet for Dockerâ€™s bridge network.

44. **B - Trivy**
    Trivy is a vulnerability scanner for Docker images.

45. **A - ADD supports remote URLs and unpacking**
    ADD does more than COPY, like fetching URLs or extracting archives.

46. **B - docker login**
    Authenticates to Docker Hub or private registry.

47. **D - All of the above**
    Docker Desktop includes CLI, engine, GUI, and Kubernetes.
