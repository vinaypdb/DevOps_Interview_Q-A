## üîç Phase 3: AWS Advanced Topics

### Objective:

Design scalable, secure, and cost-efficient architectures.

### Topics:

1. **Databases**

   * RDS vs Aurora vs DynamoDB
   * High availability (Multi-AZ, backups)

2. **Serverless Computing**

   * AWS Lambda, API Gateway, S3 triggers

3. **Containers**

   * ECS vs EKS (Kubernetes)

4. **DevOps Tools**

   * CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy
   * Infrastructure as Code: CloudFormation/Terraform

5. **Security Services**

   * KMS, WAF, Shield, Cognito, GuardDuty

6. **Disaster Recovery**

   * Multi-region setups, Snapshots, Replication

7. **Cost Optimization**

   * Cost Explorer, Spot Instances, Budgets

### Hands-on Projects:

* Serverless app (API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB)
* Containerized app with ECS/EKS
* CI/CD pipeline with CodePipeline

## üìô Phase 4: Mastery & Teaching Others

### Objective:

Reinforce your AWS knowledge through teaching and advanced architecture.

### Activities:

1. **Teach-Backs**

   * Blog posts or YouTube tutorials
   * Explain key services: VPC, IAM, Lambda, etc.

2. **Whiteboarding**

   * Draw & explain architectures:

     * Scalable Web App
     * E-commerce Platform
     * Real-time Analytics Pipeline

3. **Certifications (Optional)**
